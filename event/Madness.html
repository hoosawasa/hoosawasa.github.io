			<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
				<p>"The nations of the world are uneasy following the previous event, causing tensions to rise in political and economic portions of the mortal population. Within the unease, a strange and bizarre ailment has begun to affect a small few in the major cities of the world—unseen by all but those few who witness its effects first hand. It seem, as of now, to primarily influence the mind; creating harmful behaviors, exacerbating the traumas and coping mechanisms of those effected, creating a perfect storm of self destructive behaviors. Going unnoticed, these strange experiences have not yet even become rumors. Where did this begin, and how will it develop? How will the world return to normal following the things it's seen, and what part will this strange new variable play?"</p>
				<br>
				<p>This document outlines the public information that will be distributed during the In Choro Lunae event, and describes the various ways the event will be carried out.</p>
				<p>The event is designed to run for a medium length period of time, with the potential for extensions should people be interested in keeping it going. In Choro Lunae is an exploration of character's internal struggle, as well as the environmental struggle faced in the various cities around the world of Terrillam. It will deal with the themes of mental illness and recovery, as well as many other difficult topics. Due to the heavy nature of these ideas, we have chosen to make this theme opt-in rather than opt-out. To read more about the themes expressed, and to find the form to opt-in, please read our sensitivity document.</p>

				<br>
				<p>The rest of this document is information that has been publicly released Out of Character (OOC)  for the event. All information is to be considered OOC, as all In Character knowledge should be shown directly in canon works. Each section below describes an aspect of the event in detail, and may contain a small set of prompts at the end. The prompts are a collection of questions, split into categories such as "general" "group" "city" etc., that you may use as you'd like. There will be a channel made for any stories relating to the event, so we can all help build the story and see how the characters overcome the challenges they face.</p>
				<p>Please feel free to send any questions to @Hoosawasa#1111, should you be unsure about anything at all. My DM's are always open, as I have plenty of opportunities for characters to be in the spotlight during this event, and I am also more than willing to do everything I can to make you comfortable. I would absolutely prefer my story get spoiled to make sure you are ready to deal with what's to come, please just ask.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Additionally, We are looking for opportunities for smaller, more light-hearted events for those who don't wish to participate in this one. Does your city have a dragon problem, or a dark wizard conspiracy? Does your character's backstory have an untouched thieve's guild you think would be fun to throw into the world, or does your deity feel like bestowing untested and potentially volatile magic items on unsuspecting mortals for their enjoyment?</p>
				<p>If you have any fun story you'd like to play out in this world, please send a message to any of the mods and they will help you get off your feet.</p>

			<h2><u>Pervasive Unrest</u></h2>
				<p>A few months have passed since the previous events in Terrillam concluded. The horrors witnessed have had little time to heal, and the aftermath is still felt across the nations of the world. Those cities most heavily impacted have only just begun their recovery, and the others that bore witness to the events still have not yet truly gotten over what they saw. Although it has been a quiet time since then, there is still turmoil rising in areas of the land, whether they be from before the event or lingering remnants of what occurred.</p>
				<p>There is a palpable unease in the cities, as there always is with strange times. The people seek to move on from what they saw, some angry that it was ever allowed to happen, others simply wishing to forget the things they witnessed. There is tension in parts of the world, as the peace between cities has taken a toll due to the stress of what's occurred. Many are feeling as though things have changed, and they are unable to find their new normal.</p>

			<h2><u>A Stranger in the Lands</u></h2>
				<p>Across the nations of Terrillam, there have been sightings of a young mortal man. He seems to be travelling to all the capitals of the world, and performing some sort of study. Although, normally, someone like this would be lost within the bustling crowds of the cities, he has brought attention to himself as he has been asking the citizens of each city a series of peculiar questions, and seems to be possessing a strange item filled with powerful magic. What exactly he's doing in the capitals is, as of yet, unknown, although there are many interested eyes watching him.</p>
