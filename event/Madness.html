			<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
				<p style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 900;">"The nations of the world are uneasy following the previous event, causing tensions to rise in political and economic portions of the mortal population. Within the unease, a strange and bizarre ailment has begun to affect a small few in the major cities of the world—unseen by all but those few who witness its effects first hand. It seem, as of now, to primarily influence the mind; creating harmful behaviors, exacerbating the traumas and coping mechanisms of those effected, creating a perfect storm of self destructive behaviors. Going unnoticed, these strange experiences have not yet even become rumors. Where did this begin, and how will it develop? How will the world return to normal following the things it's seen, and what part will this strange new variable play?"</p>
				<br>
				<p>This document outlines the public information that will be distributed during the In Choro Lunae event, and describes the various ways the event will be carried out.</p>
				<p>The event is designed to run for a medium length period of time, with the potential for extensions should people be interested in keeping it going. In Choro Lunae is an exploration of character's internal struggle, as well as the environmental struggle faced in the various cities around the world of Terrillam. It will deal with the themes of mental illness and recovery, as well as many other difficult topics. Due to the heavy nature of these ideas, we have chosen to make this theme opt-in rather than opt-out. To read more about the themes expressed, and to find the form to opt-in, please read our sensitivity document.</p>
				<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zl6Dk90rT-DRMO3vNR7nO8oIH-vjyepmTBCHgKzN-TI/edit?usp=sharing"><p style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em;">In Choro Lunae CW Doc</p></a>
				<p>The rest of this document is information that has been publicly released Out of Character (OOC)  for the event. All information is to be considered OOC, as all In Character knowledge should be shown directly in canon works. Each section below describes an aspect of the event in detail, and may contain a small set of prompts at the end. The prompts are a collection of questions, split into categories such as "general" "group" "city" etc., that you may use as you'd like. There will be a channel made for any stories relating to the event, so we can all help build the story and see how the characters overcome the challenges they face.</p>
				<p>Please feel free to send any questions to @Hoosawasa#1111, should you be unsure about anything at all. My DM's are always open, as I have plenty of opportunities for characters to be in the spotlight during this event, and I am also more than willing to do everything I can to make you comfortable. I would absolutely prefer my story get spoiled to make sure you are ready to deal with what's to come, please just ask.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Additionally, We are looking for opportunities for smaller, more light-hearted events for those who don't wish to participate in this one. Does your city have a dragon problem, or a dark wizard conspiracy? Does your character's backstory have an untouched thieve's guild you think would be fun to throw into the world, or does your deity feel like bestowing untested and potentially volatile magic items on unsuspecting mortals for their enjoyment?</p>
				<p>If you have any fun story you'd like to play out in this world, please send a message to any of the mods and they will help you get off your feet.</p>

			<h2><u>Pervasive Unrest</u></h2>
				<p>A few months have passed since the previous events in Terrillam concluded. The horrors witnessed have had little time to heal, and the aftermath is still felt across the nations of the world. Those cities most heavily impacted have only just begun their recovery, and the others that bore witness to the events still have not yet truly gotten over what they saw. Although it has been a quiet time since then, there is still turmoil rising in areas of the land, whether they be from before the event or lingering remnants of what occurred.</p>
				<p>There is a palpable unease in the cities, as there always is with strange times. The people seek to move on from what they saw, some angry that it was ever allowed to happen, others simply wishing to forget the things they witnessed. There is tension in parts of the world, as the peace between cities has taken a toll due to the stress of what's occurred. Many are feeling as though things have changed, and they are unable to find their new normal.</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
					  <td>General Prompt: How has your character been dealing with the recovering world? Were they impacted by what they saw/experienced, and if they were how are they processing that now? What have they been doing in the time since the event concluded? Were there any behaviors they learned during the event that would still be impacting them, and are they taking any steps to recover?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					  <td>Otherworldly Prompt: How has your deity guided you during the recovery? Have you been required to do anything on behalf of your deity, such as reap or help with the recovery? Have you found support in your deity as you process what's happened, or do you feel as though the world of mortals is beneath you/none of your business?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					  <td>News Prompt: Have you been covering any of the recovery/aftermath? What sorts of stories have been in the news over the past few months? If your station employed anyone involved with the event, how have things been managed (rehired, replaced,  ignored, memorialized, erased, etc.)? What sorts of stories have you been broadcasting—happy feel good stories, gritty stories covering the dark aspects of the world, life pieces to help cover the day to day process, etc?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					  <td>City Prompt: If your city was impacted during the last event, how has it been recovering? Think both about the people, and the city itself (infrastructure, royals/governments, etc.). If your city was simply watching from afar, did the events that transpired invoke any knew feelings in the people, or legislature in the government? Were any steps taken to prevent something similar from happening in your city? </td>

			<h2><u>A Stranger in the Lands</u></h2>
				<p>Across the nations of Terrillam, there have been sightings of a young mortal man. He seems to be travelling to all the capitals of the world, and performing some sort of study. Although, normally, someone like this would be lost within the bustling crowds of the cities, he has brought attention to himself as he has been asking the citizens of each city a series of peculiar questions, and seems to be possessing a strange item filled with powerful magic. What exactly he's doing in the capitals is, as of yet, unknown, although there are many interested eyes watching him.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 0.6em; text-align: right;">If you'd like to know more, please DM Ian (@Hoosawasa#1111) for specifics about this character and about prompts.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="contentBox" id="lukas" style="display: none;">
			<h2><u>Lukas Attomy</u></h2>
			<h3>Appearance</h3>
			<p>Lukas is a young man, standing around 6'. He is 23, the last of his youthful features fading  away to reveal the face of a young man. His hair is short and stark white, a medium length cut around the front that's styled to form a little peak of white above his brow. His eyebrows and eyelashes are also white, which is a stark contrast to his tanned skin and cyan eyes. He has a short nose, a strong jawline that has a bit of white stubble from his journey, and small pointed ears angled slightly upwards.</p>
			<p>He wears a button up shirt with a standard traveller's cloak, a pair of canvas pants tucked into heavy leather boots, and a large scarf wrapped around his neck. Most of the things he has are tucked into a pack he keeps under his cloak, which also hides his shortsword and various daggers.</p>
			<h3>Personality</h3>
			<p>He is an amicable young man, with a hearty sense of humor despite his relative seriousness. Lukas sees his mission as one of utmost importance, and this responsibility tends to make him come across as a little overly diplomatic. He is strangely unfamiliar with the world and how it works, so he can occasionally not understand topics that would otherwise be obvious to most. He is, however, always very neat, timely, and well spoken.
			</p>
			<p>He seems to be secretive about aspects of his life, dodging questions relating to where he's from and what his past is like. Other than this, however, he seems more than willing to discuss his intentions.</p>
			<h3>His Mission</h3>
			<p>Lukas describes himself as a follower of the God "sanity", a god that has been lost to the world for thousands of years. He says he has been contacted by the God, and given a great mission—To stop the end of the world. He says Madness, the counterpart to sanity, has returned as well, and seeks to consume the world. It will drag all into an endless unknown, unless something is done to prevent it.</p>
			<p>He describes the current part of his mission as surveying, trying to see how much damage has already been done. He's travelling the land, using a device he was granted by his God that allows him to see and record the effects of madness that have already begun to take hold in the world. He's also asking people about recent events and how they've impacted individuals, as well as the world at large. </p>
			<p>He says he's afraid that all the chaos of the past few months could potentially create the perfect opportunity for madness to begin its attempts to enter back into the world—in fact, he believes that it was these circumstances that led to madness' return in the first place. He wants to keep the situation secret for the time being, despite its urgency, as the fear that spreading the information too soon would cause would almost certainly lead to further harm done—among other reasons.
			</p>
			<h3>The Item</h3>
			<p>He holds a strange item, that he refuses to give to anyone. It looks like a floating black <a href="https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/impossible-objects-vol-2/128/Prancheta_44-512.png">pyramid</a>—however the geometry of the object seems impossible, like a physical optical illusion. About the size of a golf ball, it floats above any surface never touching anything, and it always is surrounded by a dark glow of magic. If seen using it, he will take the object out, look through it at various angles, and jot certain information down—although he prefers to keep the item hidden as it seems to be very important to him.</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
				  <td>General Prompt: Has your character directly interacted with him? Were they questioned by him? Did they follow him out of curiosity, or to discover why he's here? Were they sent to investigate him on behalf of someone else? Did they see his strange item?</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td>City Prompt: Did your city notice the stranger asking odd questions? How was he received by the people? Would an outsider like him stand out in the crowds? Would his strange item bring attention to him, or blend in with the rest of the city? Would the government officials notice him? Would he get questioned in turn?</td>
