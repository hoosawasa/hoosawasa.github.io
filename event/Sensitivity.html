			<h1>Sensitivity Document</h1>
			<p>The last thing anyone here wants is to hurt someone, whether that be with a harmful portrayal, or forcing them to see something they do not want to, or any of the other many ways we can hurt and be hurt in writing. This document will go over some of the ways that we can all avoid that while dealing with these heavy topics. It's also why this event will be opt in.</p>
			<p>The first, and most important thing we all need to know is that communication is always the best idea. When in doubt about something you've written, how someone else is writing something, how a situation is being handled, etc. it's always best to talk about it. Ask questions, speak up, and listen to what others have to say. If you aren't sure about something, please reach out to any of us. There's no need for you to be alone, we all want to be here for one another.</p>
			<h2>What to expect</h2>
			<p>The event is expected to last a medium length of time, although it may be extended if it is well received, and the story is not yet concluded. It will play out primarily through "updates" similar to the previous events, but will also have space for written works to describe the events going on.</p>
			<p>The themes will deal with mental illness and recovery, global strife, political upset, lying and manipulation, heavenly battles, and potentially character death. All heavy topics will be spoilered and given warnings ahead of time, and there are several places where you may request specific content warnings. As always, any and all character death will be warned ahead of time for those who have requested it.</p>
			<h2>Guidelines</h2>
			<p>These topics are not easy to deal with, and have the potential to be harmful if not treated with care. Please, if you aren't sure about somethings, feel free to ask anyone as we would prefer you communicate before hurting someone.</p>
			<p>In addition to open communication, we ask you please read the following sections which highlight some things you should keep in mind while going into this event.</p>
			<h2>Sanity is not Morality | Madness is not Evil</h2>
			<p>The mentally ill are often portrayed as monsters—evil villains that have uncertain morals due to unnamed insanity, unpredictable and emotional manipulators, disconnected individuals who seemingly have no reason—these tropes are created and used to make it easier to abuse the mentally ill, plain and simple.</p>
			<p>In no way should these ideas continue. Please refrain from portraying anyone as a monster for experiencing these things. Unhealthy behaviors can be scary, but those impacted by these problems are first and foremost victims. Try to stay away from changing a character's personality for no reason other than drama, as this is a way to quickly slide into harmful and abusive tropes. If you character isn't manipulative, violent, or otherwise harmful, then there are very few reasons for why they would suddenly change and become purposefully abusive.</p>
			<h2>Describe, Don't Diagnose</h2>
			<p>It can be tempting to diagnose our characters with various mental illnesses, and in some situations this comes from an area of representation and self-reflection—those who have a certain diagnosis creating characters who experience the things we experience. In these cases, in which one has first hand knowledge they can base their character off of, I will leave it to them to determine how respectfully they can represent a character.</p>
			<p>However, in most other circumstances, it's best to describe how a character's behaviors and responses are affected by the things they're seeing and interacting with, but not try to diagnose them with some mental illness. If we attempt to diagnose our characters and work from there, we can fall into harmful over-the-top stereotypes based on what we think that diagnosis means. This is an easy way to make our stories inaccessible and harmful.</p>
			<h2>Catharsis over Senselessness</h2>
			<p>Most of us like angst, to at least some degree, and some of us live for the angst. Exploring a character's traumas and issues is extremely fun and interesting, and allows us an insight into their story that we may not otherwise get. In fact, that's the main driving force behind this event—a way to explore how characters deal with their own internal conflicts, and how they help one another get through it.</p>
			<p>That being said, endless angst is tiring. Unending suffering with no hope, no end in sight, no moments to breath quickly goes from interesting to depressing. No one can stop you from writing something truly sad—in fact, we'll most likely be waiting with bated breath to see just how bad things can get—but we would recommend staying away from endless hopelessness. A large focus of this event is mental health, and many of these character have aspects of their creators; There's a reason for the focus on recovery. Hopelessness isn't what we're trying to achieve here. Also, it's just good writing practice to give some light at the end of the tunnel, even if it ends up being just more fire to burn the character. Pain is meaningless without hope.</p>
			<p>That being said, no one's gonna stop you if you want to have your character suffer endlessly. Go for it.</p>
			<h2>Extreme does not mean Exotic</h2>
			<p>Most of these character have already seen great struggle, whether that be in their backstory, or in the previous events that have taken place in this world. It would be shocking if they didn't have some sort of trauma to work through, especially given the nature of the world of terrillam—years of war, struggle, celestial influences, mass murder, and other horrors occur fairly regularly. The effects of these are things everyone deals with, not strange or horrifying sicknesses. Although they've been exacerbated by the scenario, they are in no way something to be ashamed of. Try to refrain from portraying your character as tainted or broken by the things they're experiencing—mental illness does not make us less.</p>
